## **Forensic Science at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences**
### Graduation product (year 4)
**_Time period:_** 02/2025 to 07/2025<br/>
**_Commissioning company:_** Netherlands Forensic Institute
<br/>
<br/>
**_Description:_** This internship consisted of work on two different topics:
* **Profieciency test:** Creating a feedback report according to the 'framework of the conduct of proficiency tests within ENFSI': containing the variety in results, methods and conclusions of different accredited organizations for determining the provenance of images from smartphones released past the conduct of the last proficiency test.
* **Experiment:** Determining the influence of 'night mode'/'night sight' on the PRNU-pattern in images obtained from smartphones released past the year 2018

<br/>

**_Contributions:_**
* Written a **Python Script** which can **indicate the origin of images** based on a folder containing .csv files with cross-correlationvalues of the compared images.
* Performed a proficiency test to **control the competence of accredited (forensic) organisations** by examining the variance in results and conclusions, when determining  the origin of images acquired from smartphones by using different (PRNU-based) camera identity determination methods.
* Obtaining and reading metadata through exiftool and ffmpeg.
* Written multiple smaller **scripts** for **Command Prompt in Windows**:
  * Stripping all metadata
  * Adjusting resolution
  * Rotating images
  * Flipping images

### _'Data2Activity'_
**_Time period:_** 08/2024 to 01/2025 <br/>
**_Commissioning company:_** Netherlands Forensic Institute
<br/>
<br/>
**_Description:_** Digital consumer electronics have become more integrated in everyday life. These devices contain copious digital information, which could be relevant for criminal investigations. For instance, information about health or location is obtainable from modern smartphones. This project aims to create clarification and insight in the value of digital information from the devices for (criminal) investigations. <br/>
This part of the study was specifically aimed to determine the reliability of digital traces in the iPhones obtained from travel activityies in free-living conditions in comparison to controlled experiments.

<br/>

**_Contributions:_**
* **Gathered digital traces in iPhones**, alongside MoveSense and McRoberts activity trackers, by perfoming various physical activities _(walking, running, biking, public transportations, climbing/descending stairs, etc)_
* Colaborated in the **analysis of files** from the _Healthdb_secure.sqlite, Cache_encryptedC.db, Unified logging, Cache.sqlite and Knowledge.C_ **databases**.
* Colaborated in creation of a **script**, which **automatically creates confusion matrixes** for digital traces obtained from the **_Cache_encryptedC.db_ database** _(MotionStateHistory, NatalieHistory, StepCountHistory)_

### Minor: _'Digital Forensis: From Bit to Evidence'_
**_Time period:_** 01/2024 to 07/2024 <br/>
**_Commissioning company:_** Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences
<br/>
<br/>
**_Description:_** During this module various methods for **(forensic) digital investigations** are covered and examinated. Also a fictional digital case centering a **ATM bombing** was created by the students for fellow students of the module to **reconstruct** through analysing **digital traces** obtained from **smartphones**.
